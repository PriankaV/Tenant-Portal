# Tenant Management System (TMS) 🏠💼
The **Tenant Management System (TMS)** is a web-based application designed to simplify the management of rental properties for property managers and tenants. By providing a user-friendly interface and robust backend, TMS centralizes tenant information, lease agreements, rent payments, and property documents, allowing property managers to efficiently manage their properties, while tenants have seamless access to essential information and services.
